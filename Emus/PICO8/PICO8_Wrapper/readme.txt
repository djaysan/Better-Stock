PICO8 Wrapper allow to use the original PICO-8 on the TrimUI Smart Pro.
It maximize the compatibility and allow to use Splore (online game store from PICO-8 community).

To use the official PICO-8, you need to add your purchased binaries.
You can purchase Pico-8 here (choose Raspberry version) :
https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php

You'll need to provide 2 files:
- pico8_64
- pico8.dat

These files need to be copied in the "Emus/PICO/PICO8_Wrapper/bin" directory before you try to run the wrapper.

Note : Keybinds, Bezels and overclock  are currently not compatible with the current TrimUI Smart Pro version
To force exit PICO-8 on CrossMix-OS press Menu + Power buttons during 3 seconds.

Keybinds:
=========
Select + Menu - quit
Select + Up/Down Dpad = CPU clock modifier
Select + Left/Right Dpad = bezel/Bezel/Overlay modifier
L2 button - Lock into mouse mode, (other input will be disabled while in mouse mode)
      - A/B - click in mouse mode
Select + L1 - reload cart
Select + R1 - change screen scaling

Pico-8 Keybinds are very simple, with A+B being actions and Dpad being movement ofc.
